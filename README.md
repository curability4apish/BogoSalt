# Why
A truely random salt significantly enhances security, especially in contexts involving hashing and password storage, as it is resistant to Pre-Computed Attacks and Brute Force Attacks.

No warranty, but feel free to test it with a Shannon Entropy calculator.

# How

The entropy source is the uncertainty of time spent on bogosort benchmark in 0.1Î¼s scale.
The entropy is magnified with transcendentals and mathematical operations.
Executable on WindowsOS.
